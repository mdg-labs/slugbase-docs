## Component Structure

```tsx
<Folders>
  <Header>
    <Title>
    <Count>
    <Create Button>
  </Header>
  <Folders Grid>
    <Folder Card>
      <Icon>
      <Name & Badges>
      <Shared Teams>
      <Actions>
    </Card>
  </Grid>
  <Folder Modal>
  <Confirm Dialog>
</Folders>
```

## API Integration

- `GET /folders` - Fetch all folders
- `GET /teams` - Fetch teams for sharing
- `POST /folders` - Create new folder
- `PUT /folders/:id` - Update folder
- `DELETE /folders/:id` - Delete folder

## Folder Icons

Folders support icons from the Lucide icon library:
- Icons are displayed in a searchable modal
- Popular icons are pre-selected for quick access
- Users can type any icon name to use custom icons
- Icons are stored as string identifiers (e.g., "folder", "book", "star")

## Bookmark Association

- Folders are associated with bookmarks through a many-to-many relationship
- A bookmark can belong to multiple folders
- Deleting a folder does not delete associated bookmarks
- Bookmarks are shown on the [Bookmarks](bookmarks) page with folder badges

## Styling

- Modern card design with rounded corners (`rounded-xl`)
- Blue gradient icon backgrounds
- Hover effects with border color change and shadow
- Consistent badge styling with borders
- Responsive grid: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4`
- Spacing: `gap-4`, padding: `p-5`

## Related Components

- `FolderModal` - Create/edit folder form with icon picker
- `FolderIcon` - Displays folder icons (handles missing icons gracefully)
- `ConfirmDialog` - Deletion confirmation

## Related Pages

- [Bookmarks](bookmarks) - View bookmarks filtered by folder
- [Shared](shared) - View shared folders

## Technical Details

- **Component File**: `frontend/src/pages/Folders.tsx`
- **State Management**: React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Icon System**: Lucide React icons
- **API Client**: Custom API client with interceptors

## i18n Keys Used

- `folders.*` - All folder-related strings
- `common.*` - Common UI strings (loading, edit, delete, etc.)

## Performance Considerations

- Folders are loaded on component mount
- Icon rendering is optimized with caching
- Grid layout optimizes for different screen sizes
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks
