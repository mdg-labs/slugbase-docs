# Login and Auth Providers

SlugBase Cloud supports multiple sign-in options so you can use the account you already have.

## Supported providers

- **Google** – Sign in with your Google account
- **Microsoft** – Sign in with a Microsoft or work/school account
- **GitHub** – Sign in with your GitHub account

You can also use **email and password** if your account was created that way or if your admin enabled local auth.

## How it works

1. On the login page, choose a provider (e.g. “Login with Google”).
2. You are redirected to that provider to sign in.
3. After you approve access, you are redirected back to SlugBase Cloud and are logged in.

Sessions are kept secure with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens; you may be asked to sign in again after long inactivity or when we rotate tokens.

## Account linking

If you first sign up with one provider, that provider is linked to your SlugBase Cloud account. Using a different provider may create a separate account unless we support linking in the future; check the in-app help for current behavior.
