# What is SlugBase Cloud

SlugBase Cloud is the hosted SaaS version of SlugBase. Use bookmark management, folders, tags, and link forwarding without running your own server.

## Hosted by us

- No installation or server maintenance
- Automatic updates and backups
- Same core features as self-hosted SlugBase

## Getting started

1. Sign up at **[https://slugbase.app](https://slugbase.app)** (or log in with Google, Microsoft, or GitHub).
2. Create your first bookmark and organize with folders and tags.
3. Optionally enable link forwarding for short URLs.
