# Data and Privacy

A high-level overview of how SlugBase Cloud handles your data and privacy.

## Where your data lives

- Your bookmarks, folders, tags, and account data are stored in SlugBase Cloud infrastructure.
- Data is stored in a secure, access-controlled environment and is not used for advertising or sold to third parties.

## What we do with your data

- We use your data to provide the service: storing and serving your bookmarks, enabling sharing (when you choose it), and powering features like link forwarding.
- We may use aggregated, non-personal statistics to improve the product (e.g. performance, reliability).
- We do not sell your personal data or bookmark content.

## Security and access

- Access to the application and API is protected by authentication (e.g. OIDC or email/password).
- Data is isolated per account (and per team where applicable) so users only see what they are allowed to access.
- We follow security best practices for handling credentials and sensitive data.

## Privacy policy

For full details, data retention, and legal terms, see our official Privacy Policy and Terms of Service when you sign up or in the app footer. This page is a short summary and may be updated as the product evolves.
