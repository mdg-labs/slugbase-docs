# Shared Page

## Overview

The Shared page displays bookmarks and folders that have been shared with the current user by other users or teams. It provides a separate view for accessing shared content, distinguishing it from the user's own content.

## User Interactions

### Viewing Shared Content

1. Navigate to the Shared page
2. Toggle between Bookmarks and Folders tabs
3. View shared items (read-only access)

### Opening Shared Bookmarks

1. Click the "Open" button on a bookmark card
2. Bookmark opens in a new tab
3. Original URL is accessed (not forwarded through SlugBase)

### Copying Forwarding URLs

1. If a shared bookmark has forwarding enabled, click the copy icon
2. URL is copied to clipboard
3. Toast notification confirms copy

### Filtering

- Shared content is automatically filtered to show only items not owned by the current user
- No additional filtering options (by design, this is a dedicated "shared" view)

## Empty State

When no shared content exists:

**Bookmarks Tab:**
- Displays share icon
- Shows "No shared bookmarks yet" message

**Folders Tab:**
- Displays share icon
- Shows "No shared folders yet" message

## Component Structure

```tsx
<Shared>
  <Header>
    <Title>
    <Description>
  </Header>
  <Tabs>
    <Bookmarks Tab>
    <Folders Tab>
  </Tabs>
  <Content>
    {activeTab === 'bookmarks' ? (
      <Bookmarks Grid>
        <Shared Bookmark Card>
      </Grid>
    ) : (
      <Folders Grid>
        <Shared Folder Card>
      </Grid>
    )}
  </Content>
</Shared>
```

## API Integration

- `GET /bookmarks` - Fetches all bookmarks (frontend filters to shared ones)
- `GET /folders` - Fetches all folders (frontend filters to shared ones)

**Note**: The filtering logic happens on the frontend. The API returns all accessible bookmarks/folders, and the component filters based on `user_id` to show only items not owned by the current user.

## Sharing Mechanism

### How Content Becomes Shared

1. **Bookmark Sharing**:
   - Owner selects teams/users when creating/editing bookmark
   - Selected users/teams get access to the bookmark

2. **Folder Sharing**:
   - Owner selects teams/users when creating/editing folder
   - Selected users/teams get access to the folder and its bookmarks

### Access Control

- Shared content is **read-only** for non-owners
- Users can view but cannot edit or delete shared items
- Only the owner can modify shared content

## Card Design

- Same modern design as Bookmarks and Folders pages
- Consistent styling for visual coherence
- "Shared" badges clearly indicate shared status
- Owner information provides context
- Read-only indicators (no edit/delete buttons)

## Related Components

- `Favicon` - Displays bookmark favicons
- `FolderIcon` - Displays folder icons

## Related Pages

- [Bookmarks](bookmarks) - View own bookmarks
- [Folders](folders) - View own folders
- [Profile](profile) - User profile and settings

## Technical Details

- **Component File**: `frontend/src/pages/Shared.tsx`
- **State Management**: React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Filtering Logic**: Client-side filtering by `user_id`
- **Tab Management**: Local state with `useState`
- **API Client**: Custom API client with interceptors

## i18n Keys Used

- `shared.*` - All shared page strings
- `bookmarks.*` - Bookmark-related strings
- `folders.*` - Folder-related strings
- `common.*` - Common UI strings

## Performance Considerations

- Content is filtered on the frontend (all accessible items are fetched)
- Efficient re-renders when switching tabs
- Lazy loading of favicons
- Grid layout optimizes for different screen sizes

## User Experience Notes

1. **Clear Distinction**: The Shared page clearly separates shared content from owned content
2. **Read-Only Access**: No edit/delete buttons prevent accidental modifications
3. **Owner Context**: Shows who shared the content for better context
4. **Tab Navigation**: Easy switching between bookmarks and folders
5. **Consistent Design**: Same card design as other pages for familiarity
